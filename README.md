A CLIPS project for the AI Lab at University of Turin

Open the `run.bat` file and type `(batch loads)` command to initialize the environment. 
Then type `(run)` command to start it. 
You can also specify a not mandatory integer n argument to execute n step at the time; i.e. `(run 4)` executes a run of 4 steps.

At the end of each run you must reinitialize the environment to run it again.
